Frontier provides two different strategies for handling `H160` addresses.

# H256 -> H160 mapping

The first strategy consists of of a truncated hash scheme, where the first 160 LE bytes of a `H256` address are used to form the `H160` address.

`AccountId32` is the Account type used for `frame_system::pallet::Config::AccountId`.

The Runtime's `Signature` type is configured as [`sp_runtime::MultiSignature`](https://docs.rs/sp-runtime/2.0.1/sp_runtime/enum.MultiSignature.html), which means signatures can be:
- `Sr25519`
- `Ed25519`
- `ECDSA`

# Unified Accounts

The second strategy was [originally implemented by Moonbeam](https://docs.moonbeam.network/learn/features/unified-accounts/).
It consists of using `fp-account` so that `AccountId20` is the Account type used for 
`frame_system::pallet::Config::AccountId`.

The Runtime's `Signature` type is configured as `EthereumSigner`, which means only `ECDSA` signatures are supported.

Frontier's Template will pre-fund several well-known addresses that (mostly) contain the letters "th" in their names to remind you that they are for ethereum-compatible usage. These addresses are derived from Substrate's canonical mnemonic: `bottom drive obey lake curtain smoke basket hold race lonely fit walk`

# Template Runtimes

Frontier provides two different runtimes, one for each strategy.
You can choose which one want to build by using the `--feature` flag. For example:
```
$ cargo build                             # this builds a runtime with H256 -> H160 mapping
$ cargo build --features unified-accounts # this builds a runtime with Unified Accounts
